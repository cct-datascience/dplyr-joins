# Combining datasets with 'dplyr'

This repo contains the data files and starter script for the [March 2023 Workshop Wednesday](https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/events/186-combining-datasets-using-dplyr) and is intended as a review of data wrangling and a demonstration of joins in dplyr 1.1.0. Data are from `ratdat` package and materials are based on a Carpentries-style [lesson](https://www.michaelc-m.com/Rewrite-R-ecology-lesson/04-putting-it-together.html) by Michael Culshaw-Maurer.

The associated [slide deck](https://viz.datascience.arizona.edu/dplyr-joins-slides/) contains introduction to joins and the new dplyr 1.1.0 syntax based on the in-progress 2nd edition of R4DS, [chapter 20](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/joins.html).

### Instructions

1.) Obtain repository locally via cloning, downloading the .zip file, or using `usethis::use_course("cct-datascience/dplyr-joins")`

2.) Open the associated RStudio project by clicking on 'dplyr-joins.Rproj'

3.) In your R console, type `renv::restore()`, which will install the correct package versions needed for this workshop. If the `renv` package is new to you, [this](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) is a nice introduction

4.) Open '01-wrangle-data.R', the starter script for the code-along portion of the workshop

Source code for the slide deck and the completed scripts are available in this [workshop folder](https://github.com/cct-datascience/CALS-workshops/tree/main/202303-dplyr-joins) of the CALS-workshops repository.
