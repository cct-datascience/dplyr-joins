# Combining datasets with 'dplyr'

This repo contains the data files and starter script for the [March 2023 Workshop Wednesday](https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/events/186-combining-datasets-using-dplyr). 

To get started:

1.) Clone or download this repository 

2.) Open the associated RStudio project by clicking on 'dplyr-joins.Rproj' 

3.) In your R console, type `renv::restore()`, which will install the correct package versions needed for this workshop. If the `renv` package is new to you, [this](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) is a nice introduction

4.) Open '01-wrangle-data.R', the starter script for the code-along portion of the workshop
